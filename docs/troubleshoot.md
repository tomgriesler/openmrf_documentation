## Stimulation limit exceeded
This may be one of the most common issues you'll run into. Even if you double-checked all parameters and the PNS simulation predicted moderate values, your scanner might not execute your sequence (or abort halfway through) and display a warning that the stimulation limit was exceeded. Luckily for you, in most cases this is an easy fix. You'll need to reduce the slew rate.
