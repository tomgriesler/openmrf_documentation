# Welcome to the OpenMRF Documentation website! 

OpenMRF is currently under active development. A corresponding publication describing the framework in detail will be released soon. Please watch out for this publication and use it for citation once available.

## Introduction

OpenMRF is a modular and vendor-neutral framework for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) built on the open-source Pulseq standard. It is built upon the MATLAB version of Pulseq by Kelvin J. Layton and Maxim Zaitsev (<https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.26235>). OpenMRF unifies all core components of the MRF workflow within a single MATLAB-based toolbox: flexible sequence generation, automated Bloch-based dictionary simulation, and low-rank image reconstruction. The provided tools support a wide range of contrast preparations and readouts (e.g., spiral, radial, rosette) and include integrated solutions for trajectory calibration, spin-lock modeling, slice profile simulation, and metadata storage. Designed for reproducibility and portability, OpenMRF enables easy deployment of MRF protocols across multiple scanner platforms, including Siemens and GE systems.
